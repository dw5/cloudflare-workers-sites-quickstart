Getting started

    Ensure you have the latest version of git

and Node.js

installed.

In your terminal, clone the worker-sites-template starter repository. The following example creates a project called my-site:

git clone --depth=1 --branch=wrangler2 https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template my-site

Run npm install to install all dependencies.

You can preview your site by running the wrangler dev command:

wrangler dev

Publish your site to Cloudflare:

wrangler publish

​​
Project layout

The template project contains the following files and directories:

    public: The static assets for your project. By default it contains an index.html and a favicon.ico.
    src: The Worker configured for serving your assets. You do not need to edit this but if you want to see how it works or add more functionality to your Worker, you can edit src/index.ts.
    wrangler.toml: The file containing project configuration. The bucket property tells Wrangler where to find the static assets (e.g. site = { bucket = "./public" }).
    package.json/package-lock.json: define the required Node.js dependencies.
